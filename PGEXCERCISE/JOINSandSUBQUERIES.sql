This category deals primarily with a foundational concept in relational database systems: joining.
Joining allows you to combine related information from multiple tables to answer a question. 
This isn't just beneficial for ease of querying: a lack of join capability encourages denormalisation of data, 
which increases the complexity of keeping your data internally consistent.

This topic covers inner, outer, and self joins, as well as spending a little time on subqueries (queries within queries).
If you struggle with these questions, I strongly recommend Learning SQL, by Alan Beaulieu, as a concise and well-written book on the subject.
