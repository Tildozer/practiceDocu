- acme React users still needs css to make it look pretty.

-reactHelloWorld still needs me to add my profile,
still needs tic Tac Toe to work,
todo list still needs to be able to remove things from the list,
todo should congragulate you on getting something done,
and then needs css to make it all look prettier.

- with new knowledge go back to ReactProps and make the select prop work.
